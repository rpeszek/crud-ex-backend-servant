Example backend CRUD project using Servant.  
See my CRUD umbrella project:  [typesafe-web-polyglot](https://github.com/rpeszek/typesafe-web-polyglot.git).

__ETA Language:__
This is Eta language port of this app.
This version uses embedded jetty server.
 
Work in progress.
Things are still not fully working.

Util packages are temporary hack to investigate static file serving with Eta servant.

```
etlas install --dependencies-only
```
