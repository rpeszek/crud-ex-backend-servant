Temporarily abandoned work on generating API in purescript.
This generates purescript 10.x code and I want to play with purescript 11.

Code generation is in api-to-purs, requires creating symbolic link
from /crud-ex-backend-servant/src-api to /crud-ex-backend-servant/api-to-purs/src-api

Needs some work. Generated CrudEx.Api.Common needs rethinking.
